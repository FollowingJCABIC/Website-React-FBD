# Room Order
I want the viewer to move like a procession: slow, intentional, and slightly surprised.

## Layout notes
- **Room one:** soft pieces, low lighting.
- **Room two:** high-contrast drawings, bright spotlight.
- **Room three:** one large work and a bench to sit.

## Question
What does it mean to bless a gallery space without making it heavy?
